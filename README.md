## Student Management System Java Swing Application

This repository features a student management system project developed during my Java Development Internship at InfoAid Tech. The project includes a Java Swing-based application with dual logins, catering to both students and administrators.

## Overview:
As part of the internship, I successfully developed a student management system using Java Swing. This application provides a dual-login system, allowing students to view their profiles and administrators to add and view details of all students.

## Task Accomplishments:
1. *Java Swing Development:* Utilized Java Swing to create a user-friendly graphical interface for the student management system.

2. *Dual Login System:*
   - *Student Login:* Allows students to log in and view their individual profiles.
   - *Admin Login:* Grants administrators the ability to add and view details for all students.

3. *Student Profile View:*
   - Students can access and view their personal details through an intuitive interface.

4. *Admin Controls:*
   - Administrators can add new students with relevant information.
   - Admins have the ability to view comprehensive details of all registered students.

## Project Structure:
The project is organized as follows:

1. StudentManagementSystem.java: The main Java file containing the Swing-based GUI and login logic.

2. Student.java: Java file representing the student entity and related functionalities.

3. Admin.java: Java file handling admin-related actions.

4. README.md: This file, providing an overview and description of the student management system project.

## Technologies Used:
- *Java Swing:* Employed for creating the graphical user interface.

## Usage:
To use the student management system, run the application in a Java-supported environment. Log in as a student to view the profile or as an admin to manage student details.

## Getting Started:
To get started with the Student Management System Java Swing application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/InfoAidTech-StudentManagementSystem.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd InfoAidTech-StudentManagementSystem

3. Compile and run the application:
   bash
   javac StudentManagementSystem.java
   java StudentManagementSystem
   

4. Log in as a student or an admin to explore the features of the student management system.
